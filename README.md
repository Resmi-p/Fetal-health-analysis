# Fetal-health-analysis
Fatal Health refers to a range of medical events, from chronic illnesses to acute emergencies, that can lead to death (Momeni Kho et al., 2021). It is a serious issue that poses a significant threat to life and underscores the need for accurate classification and understanding of health issues that can lead to mortality (Zermane et al., 2023). By studying Fatal Health, I can examine patterns, risk factors, and epidemiological data to inform preventive measures and healthcare policies. This project sets out to conduct a comprehensive examination into the classification of fatal health outcomes, taking into account the complex array of factors that influence mortality. The study aims to gain a holistic understanding of the nuances of fatal health occurrences. The background of the research highlights the urgent need for a nuanced classification system that takes into consideration not just traditional medical parameters, but also socio-economic disparities, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences.

-**Research Questions**:
How do various machine learning models compare in terms of accuracy and reliability for the classification of fatal health conditions based on medical data?
What is the impact of feature selection techniques on the performance of machine learning models in identifying fatal health conditions, and which methods prove to be most effective?

-**Dataset**:
The dataset available on Kaggle is a valuable resource for healthcare researchers, offering information derived from Cardiotocogram (CTG) exams. This information is classified into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological, based on the assessment of three expert obstetricians. The CTG exams monitor foetal heart rate and uterine contractions during pregnancy, providing insights into the wellbeing of the unborn child.

-**Methodology**:
The methodology is designed to ensure the integrity of the data through a systematic approach that begins with data cleaning. After that, thorough data analysis is conducted to extract meaningful insights. Pre-processing activities are then carried out to refine the data and optimize it for machine learning algorithms. The core of the methodology involves employing six distinct models, which are subjected to a comparative analysis to gauge their effectiveness. This rigorous evaluation process aims to identify the model with superior predictive capabilities, which contributes to robust and reliable outcomes. The structured methodology, which spans data preparation, analysis, and machine learning, underscores a comprehensive strategy to glean valuable information from the Cardiotocogram dataset. This approach enhances the understanding of foetal well-being during pregnancy and helps in making informed decisions.

-**Ethical Considerations**:
The project operates ethically and it doesn't involve human participants or require approval from the University of Hertfordshire Ethics Committee. Data collection was sourced from a publicly available repository, eliminating the need for direct involvement with individuals. This adherence to ethical guidelines ensures the project's compliance with standards, given the open-source nature of the dataset, and upholds the principles of responsible and transparent research practices.
